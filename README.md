🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation — Retail Customer Analytics (Unsupervised ML)

This project applies unsupervised machine learning to segment customers of a retail mall based on their annual income and spending patterns. The objective is to help businesses design targeted marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and increase revenue through personalized engagement.

📌 Business Problem

Retail companies collect huge amounts of customer data but often struggle to utilize it effectively.
This project answers key business questions:

Which customer groups spend the most?

Which customers are budget-sensitive?

How can we target customers with tailored marketing campaigns?

Which segment has the highest conversion potential?
